# 📘 LangChain & LangGraph Learning Repository

This repository documents my structured learning journey in **LangChain** and **LangGraph** — two powerful frameworks for building production-ready AI applications using Large Language Models (LLMs).

The goal of this repository is to move from foundational concepts to advanced agentic AI workflows with hands-on implementation.

# 🚀 What is LangChain?

LangChain is a framework designed to build applications powered by LLMs.

It helps in:

- Creating multi-step LLM workflows (Chains)
- Building chatbots and assistants
- Implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Connecting LLMs with external tools, APIs, and databases
- Memory management for conversations

LangChain focuses on structured, modular LLM application development.

# 🧠 What is LangGraph?

LangGraph is built on top of LangChain and enables graph-based AI workflows.

Instead of linear chains, LangGraph allows:

- Conditional branching
- Loops
- Stateful execution
- Multi-agent systems
- Human-in-the-loop workflows

It is ideal for building:

- AI agents
- Complex orchestration systems
- Autonomous workflows
- Persistent AI systems

LangGraph gives low-level control over execution flow.

# 📚 Why Learn Both?

| LangChain | LangGraph |
|------------|------------|
| Linear workflows | Graph-based workflows |
| Easy to start | Advanced control |
| Fast prototyping | Production-grade agent orchestration |
| RAG pipelines | Stateful multi-agent systems |

LangChain is the foundation.  
LangGraph is the advanced evolution.
